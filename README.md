# 💻 Dynamic Operating System Simulation

This project is a simulation of an advanced Operating System environment, focusing on **hybrid process scheduling** and **real-time deadlock prevention** using **Banker’s Algorithm**. It is developed in **C++** for the **Operating Systems (CS-303)** course at HITEC University, Taxila.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔁 **Hybrid CPU Scheduling**:
  - Combines **Round Robin**, **Priority Scheduling**, and **Shortest Job Next (SJN)**
  - Dynamically switches based on system load

- ⚙️ **Deadlock Prevention**:
  - Uses **Banker’s Algorithm** to ensure system remains in a safe state
  - Visual representation via Resource Allocation Graph (RAG)

- ⏳ **Starvation Handling**:
  - Implements **Aging** to increase priority of long-waiting processes

- 📈 **Performance Metrics**:
  - Average waiting time
  - Turnaround time
  - Resource utilization

- 📊 **Visual Outputs**:
  - Gantt Chart for scheduling
  - RAG for deadlock detection
